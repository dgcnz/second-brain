> [!tldr] Abstract
> Deep neural networks excel in supervised learning tasks but are constrained by the need for extensive labeled data. Self-supervised learning emerges as a promising alternative, allowing models to learn without explicit labels. Information theory, and notably the information bottleneck principle, has been pivotal in shaping deep neural networks. This principle focuses on optimizing the trade-off between compression and preserving relevant information, providing a foundation for efficient network design in supervised contexts. However, its precise role and adaptation in self-supervised learning remain unclear. In this work, we scrutinize various self-supervised learning approaches from an informationtheoretic perspective, introducing a unified framework that encapsulates the self-supervised information-theoretic learning problem. We weave together existing research into a cohesive narrative, delve into contemporary self-supervised methodologies, and spotlight potential research avenues and inherent challenges. Additionally, we discuss the empirical evaluation of information-theoretic quantities and their estimation methods. Overall, this paper furnishes an exhaustive review of the intersection of information theory, self-supervised learning, and deep neural networks.
