# Second Brain

My personal notes on AI/ML papers, ideas, and random thoughts - exported from Obsidian and shared here mostly so I can easily link friends to stuff I'm thinking about.

## What's this?

Just my Obsidian vault made public. The notes are often rough, incomplete, or just random connections between ideas. Sometimes I'll read a few papers on a theme and write something like "Are less inductive biases better or worse?" to work through my thoughts. Other times it's just quick summaries of papers I found interesting or notes from lectures.

It's pretty crude but gets the job done for sharing ideas without friction.

## Setup

This uses [mkdocs-frontmatter-plugin](https://github.com/dgcnz/mkdocs-frontmatter-plugin) to export Obsidian vaults to a searchable site. If you want to replicate this setup for your own vault:

```bash
poetry install
mkdocs serve
```

The plugin handles Obsidian-style links and frontmatter, so most notes should just work.

## Structure

- `000 Zettelkasten/` - atomic notes on concepts and ideas
- `100 Reference notes/` - paper summaries, author profiles, etc.

Browse around, most things are interconnected. Use the search if you're looking for something specific.

Nothing fancy, just a way to share notes organically.
