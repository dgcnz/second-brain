> [!tldr] Abstract
> This paper does not describe a working system. Instead, it presents a single idea about representation which allows advances made by several diﬀerent groups to be combined into an imaginary system called GLOM1. The advances include transformers, neural ﬁelds, contrastive representation learning, distillation and capsules. GLOM answers the question: How can a neural network with a ﬁxed architecture parse an image into a partwhole hierarchy which has a diﬀerent structure for each image? The idea is simply to use islands of identical vectors to represent the nodes in the parse tree. If GLOM can be made to work, it should signiﬁcantly improve the interpretability of the representations produced by transformer-like systems when applied to vision or language.
