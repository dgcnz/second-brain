> [!tldr] Abstract
> Action-conditioned robot world models generate future video frames of the manipulated scene given a robot action sequence, offering a promising alternative for simulating tasks that are difficult to model with traditional physics engines. However, these models are optimized for short-term prediction and break down when deployed autoregressively: each predicted clip feeds back as context for the next, causing errors to compound and visual quality to rapidly degrade. We address this through the following contributions. First, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training scheme that trains the world model on its own autoregressive rollouts rather than on ground-truth histories. We achieve this by adapting a recent contrastive RL objective for diffusion models to our setting and show that its convergence guarantees carry over exactly. Second, we design a training protocol that generates and compares multiple candidate variable-length futures from the same rollout state, reinforcing higher-fidelity predictions over lower-fidelity ones. Third, we develop efficient, multi-view visual fidelity rewards that combine complementary perceptual metrics across camera views and are aggregated at the clip level for dense, low-variance training signal. Fourth, we show that our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art for rollout fidelity on the DROID dataset, outperforming the strongest baseline on all metrics (e.g., LPIPS reduced by 14% on external cameras, SSIM improved by 9.1% on the wrist camera), winning 98% of paired comparisons, and achieving an 80% preference rate in a blind human study.
