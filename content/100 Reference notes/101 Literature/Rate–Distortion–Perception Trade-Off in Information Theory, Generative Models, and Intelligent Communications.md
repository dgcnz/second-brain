> [!tldr] Abstract
> Traditional rate–distortion (RD) theory examines the trade-off between the average length of the compressed representation of a source and the additive distortions of its reconstruction. The rate–distortion–perception (RDP) framework, which integrates the perceptual dimension into the RD paradigm, has garnered significant attention due to recent advancements in machine learning, where perceptual fidelity is assessed by the divergence between input and reconstruction distributions. In communication systems where downstream tasks involve generative modeling, high perceptual fidelity is essential, despite distortion constraints. However, while zero distortion implies perfect realism, the converse is not true, highlighting an imbalance in the significance of distortion and perceptual constraints. This article clarifies that incorporating perceptual constraints does not decrease the necessary rate; instead, under certain conditions, additional rate is required, even with the aid of common and private randomness, which are key elements in generative models. Consequently, we project an increase in expected traffic in intelligent communication networks with the consideration of perceptual quality. Nevertheless, a modest increase in rate can enable generative models to significantly enhance the perceptual quality of reconstructions. By exploring the synergies between generative modeling and communication through the lens of information-theoretic results, this article demonstrates the benefits of intelligent communication systems and advocates for the application of the RDP framework in advancing compression and semantic communication research.
