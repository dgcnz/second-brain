aka: equivalecnce of group representations



TODO: add math 1+1=2 
Two representations are said to be equivalent if they relate via a similarity transform in which Q carries out the change of basis.

A representation is called reducible if it can be written as 
- add math
if the blocks are not reducible they are called irreducible reprsentations

(basically, we want to simplify the representation)
