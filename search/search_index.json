To fill this gap, we review the progress in hypernets. We present an illustrative example to train deep neural networks using hypernets and propose categorizing hypernets based on five design criteria as inputs, outputs, variability of inputs and outputs, and architecture of hypernets. We also review applications of hypernets across different deep learning problem settings, followed by a discussion of general scenarios where hypernets can be effectively employed. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions that remain under-explored in the field of hypernets. We believe that hypernetworks have the potential to revolutionize the field of deep learning.

Strongly related to the problem of numerical representation is the problem of quantization: in what manner should a set of continuous real-valued numbers be distributed over a fixed discrete set of numbers to minimize the number of bits required and also to maximize the accuracy of the attendant computations? This perennial problem of quantization is particularly relevant whenever memory and/or computational resources are severely restricted, and it has come to the forefront in recent years due to the remarkable performance of Neural Network models in computer vision, natural language processing, and related areas. Moving from floating-point representations to low-precision fixed integer values represented in four bits or less holds the potential to reduce the memory footprint and latency by a factor of 16x; and, in fact, reductions of 4x to 8x are often realized in practice in these applications. Thus, it is not surprising that quantization has emerged recently as an important and very active sub-area of research in the efficient implementation of computations associated with Neural Networks.

They can be typically adapted to diverse downstream tasks with minimal effort. However, as foundation models are usually pre-trained on images or texts sourced from the Internet, their performance in specialized domains, such as plant phenotyping, comes into question. In addition, fully fine-tuning foundation models is time-consuming and requires high computational power. This paper investigates the efficient adaptation of foundation models for plant phenotyping settings and tasks. We perform extensive experiments on fine-tuning three foundation models, MAE, DINO, and DINOv2 on three essential plant phenotyping tasks: leaf counting, instance segmentation, and disease classification.

To apply self-attention, the key-value (KV) cache of all previous sequences must be retrieved from memory at every decoding step. Thereby, this KV cache IO becomes a significant bottleneck in batch inference. We notice that these costs stem from applying self-attention on the global context, therefore we isolate the expensive bottlenecks of global modeling to lower layers and apply fast local modeling in upper layers. To mitigate the remaining costs in the lower layers, we aggregate input tokens into fixed size blocks and then apply self-attention at this coarse level. Context information is aggregated into a single embedding to enable upper layers to decode the next block of tokens, without global attention. Free of global attention bottlenecks, the upper layers can fully utilize the compute hardware to maximize inference throughput. By leveraging global and local modules, the Block Transformer architecture demonstrates 10-20x gains in inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent perplexity.

This has sparked a research agenda to reduce these models' parameter count and computational costs without significantly impacting their performance. Our study focuses on transformer-based LLMs, specifically targeting the computationally intensive feedforward networks (FFN), which are less studied than attention blocks. We consider three candidate linear layer approximations in the FFN by combining efficient low-rank and block-diagonal matrices. In contrast to many previous works that examined these approximations, our study i) explores these structures from the training-from-scratch perspective, ii) scales up to 1.3B parameters, and iii) is conducted within recent Transformer-based LLMs rather than convolutional architectures. We first demonstrate they can lead to actual computational gains in various scenarios, including online decoding when using a pre-merge technique. Additionally, we propose a novel training regime, called \\textit{self-guided training}, aimed at improving the poor training dynamics that these approximations exhibit when used from initialization. Experiments on the large RefinedWeb dataset show that our methods are both efficient and effective for training and inference.

However, we observe that the speed and accuracy of YOLOs are negatively affected by the NMS. Recently, end-to-end Transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have provided an alternative to eliminating NMS. Nevertheless, the high computational cost limits their practicality and hinders them from fully exploiting the advantage of excluding NMS. In this paper, we propose the Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR), the first real-time end-to-end object detector to our best knowledge that addresses the above dilemma. We build RT-DETR in two steps, drawing on the advanced DETR: first we focus on maintaining accuracy while improving speed, followed by maintaining speed while improving accuracy. Specifically, we design an efficient hybrid encoder to expeditiously process multi-scale features by decoupling intra-scale interaction and cross-scale fusion to improve speed. Then, we propose the uncertainty-minimal query selection to provide high-quality initial queries to the decoder, thereby improving accuracy. In addition, RT-DETR supports flexible speed tuning by adjusting the number of decoder layers to adapt to various scenarios without retraining.

To alleviate this, we present a novel collaborative hybrid assignments training scheme, namely\u00a0\ue22fo-DETR, to learn more efficient and effective DETR-based detectors from versatile label assignment manners. This new training scheme can easily enhance the encoder's learning ability in end-to-end detectors by training the multiple parallel auxiliary heads supervised by one-to-many label assignments such as ATSS and Faster RCNN. In addition, we conduct extra customized positive queries by extracting the positive coordinates from these auxiliary heads to improve the training efficiency of positive samples in the decoder. In inference, these auxiliary heads are discarded and thus our method introduces no additional parameters and computational cost to the original detector while requiring no hand-crafted non-maximum suppression (NMS).

In this paper, we show that teleportation not only speeds up optimization in the short-term, but gives overall faster time to convergence. Additionally, we show that teleporting to minima with different curvatures improves generalization and provide insights on the connection between the curvature of the minima and generalization ability. Finally, we show that integrating teleportation into a wide range of optimization algorithms and optimization-based meta-learning improves convergence.</p>","tags":["equivariance","relaxed_equivariance","dl_theory"]},{"location":"100%20Reference%20notes/101%20Literature/In%20Search%20of%20Projectively%20Equivariant%20Networks/","title":"In Search of Projectively Equivariant Networks","text":"Properties authors Georg Bokman, Axel Flinth, Fredrik Kahl year 2022 url https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14719 <p>Abstract</p> <p>Equivariance of linear neural network layers is well studied.

Quantization is a popular approach for reducing model size, but most studies mainly focus on equal bit-width quantization for the entire network, resulting in sub-optimal solutions. While there are few works on mixed precision quantization (MPQ) for ViTs, they typically rely on search space-based methods or employ mixed precision arbitrarily.

Specifically, to measure the contribution score of each layer in predicting the target class, we employ the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) method. LRP assigns local relevance at the output layer and propagates it through all layers, distributing the relevance until it reaches the input layers. These relevance scores serve as indicators for computing the layer contribution score. Additionally, we have introduced a clipped channel-wise quantization aimed at eliminating outliers from post-LayerNorm activations to alleviate severe inter-channel variations. To validate and assess our approach, we employ LRP-QViT across ViT, DeiT, and Swin transformer models on various datasets.

MIMs such as Masked Autoencoder (MAE) learn strong representations by randomly masking input tokens for the encoder to process, with the decoder reconstructing the masked tokens to the input.

To tackle the limitation, we improve MIM by explicitly incorporating unmasked tokens into the training process. Specifically, our method enables the encoder to learn from broader context supervision, allowing unmasked tokens to experience broader contexts while the decoder reconstructs masked tokens. Thus, the encoded unmasked tokens are equipped with extensive contextual information, empowering masked tokens to leverage the enhanced unmasked tokens for MIM.

We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).

Finally, we speculate that for ReLU networks, the intertwiner groups may provide a justification for the common practice of concentrating model interpretability exploration on the activation basis in hidden layers rather than arbitrary linear combinations thereof.</p> <p>Notes: - The following papers study the effect of weight space symmetries on training dynamics:     - Neural Mechanics - Symmetry and Broken Conservation Laws in Deep Learning Dynamics     - Understanding symmetries in deep networks     - G-SGD - Optimizing ReLU Neural Networks in its Positively Scale-Invariant Space      - Deep Learning Book</p>","tags":["dl_theory","dl2"]},{"location":"100%20Reference%20notes/101%20Literature/OpenELM%20-%20An%20Efficient%20Language%20Model%20Family%20with%20Open-source%20Training%20and%20Inference%20Framework/","title":"OpenELM   An Efficient Language Model Family with Open source Training and Inference Framework","text":"Properties authors Sachin Mehta, Mohammad Hossein Sekhavat, Qingqing Cao, Maxwell Horton, Yanzi Jin, Chenfan Sun, Iman Mirzadeh, Dmitry Belenko, Peter Zatloukal, Mohammad Rastegari year 2024 url https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14619 <p>Abstract</p> <p>The reproducibility and transparency of large language models are crucial for advancing open research, ensuring the trustworthiness of results, and enabling investigations into data and model biases, as well as potential risks.

We argue that progress measures can be found via mechanistic interpretability: reverse-engineering learned behaviors into their individual components. As a case study, we investigate the recently-discovered phenomenon of ``grokking'' exhibited by small transformers trained on modular addition tasks. We fully reverse engineer the algorithm learned by these networks, which uses discrete Fourier transforms and trigonometric identities to convert addition to rotation about a circle. We confirm the algorithm by analyzing the activations and weights and by performing ablations in Fourier space. Based on this understanding, we define progress measures that allow us to study the dynamics of training and split training into three continuous phases: memorization, circuit formation, and cleanup.

Recent work has argued that permutation symmetries are the only sources of non-convexity, meaning there are essentially no such barriers between trained networks if they are permuted appropriately. In this work, we refine these arguments into three distinct claims of increasing strength. We show that existing evidence only supports \"weak linear connectivity\"-that for each pair of networks belonging to a set of SGD solutions, there exist (multiple) permutations that linearly connect it with the other networks. In contrast, the claim \"strong linear connectivity\"-that for each network, there exists one permutation that simultaneously connects it with the other networks-is both intuitively and practically more desirable. This stronger claim would imply that the loss landscape is convex after accounting for permutation, and enable linear interpolation between three or more independently trained models without increased loss. In this work, we introduce an intermediate claim-that for certain sequences of networks, there exists one permutation that simultaneously aligns matching pairs of networks from these sequences. Specifically, we discover that a single permutation aligns sequences of iteratively trained as well as iteratively pruned networks, meaning that two networks exhibit low loss barriers at each step of their optimization and sparsification trajectories respectively. Finally, we provide the first evidence that strong linear connectivity may be possible under certain conditions, by showing that barriers decrease with increasing network width when interpolating among three networks.</p>","tags":["dl_theory","linear_connectivity","network_permutation_symmetries"]},{"location":"100%20Reference%20notes/101%20Literature/Stand-Alone%20Self-Attention%20in%20Vision%20Models/","title":"Stand Alone Self Attention in Vision Models","text":"Properties authors Prajit Ramachandran, Niki Parmar, Ashish Vaswani, Irwan Bello, Anselm Levskaya, Jonathon Shlens year 2019 <p>Abstract</p> <p>Convolutions are a fundamental building block of modern computer vision systems. Recent approaches have argued for going beyond convolutions in order to capture long-range dependencies. These efforts focus on augmenting convolutional models with content-based interactions, such as self-attention and non-local means, to achieve gains on a number of vision tasks. The natural question that arises is whether attention can be a stand-alone primitive for vision models instead of serving as just an augmentation on top of convolutions. In developing and testing a pure self-attention vision model, we verify that self-attention can indeed be an effective stand-alone layer. A simple procedure of replacing all instances of spatial convolutions with a form of self-attention applied to ResNet model produces a fully self-attentional model that outperforms the baseline on ImageNet classification with 12% fewer FLOPS and 29% fewer parameters. On COCO object detection, a pure self-attention model matches the mAP of a baseline RetinaNet while having 39% fewer FLOPS and 34% fewer parameters.

Although the foundation model exhibits outstanding performance in many vision tasks, including depth estimation (e.g., DINOv2), recent works observed its limitations in medical and surgical domain-specific applications. This work presents a low-ranked adaptation (LoRA) of the foundation model for surgical depth estimation. Methods: We design a foundation model-based depth estimation method, referred to as Surgical-DINO, a low-rank adaptation of the DINOv2 for depth estimation in endoscopic surgery. We build LoRA layers and integrate them into DINO to adapt with surgery-specific domain knowledge instead of conventional fine-tuning. During training, we freeze the DINO image encoder, which shows excellent visual representation capacity, and only optimize the LoRA layers and depth decoder to integrate features from the surgical scene. Results: Our model is extensively validated on a MICCAI challenge dataset of SCARED, which is collected from da Vinci Xi endoscope surgery. We empirically show that Surgical-DINO significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art models in endoscopic depth estimation tasks. The analysis with ablation studies has shown evidence of the remarkable effect of our LoRA layers and adaptation. Conclusion: Surgical-DINO shed some light on the successful adaptation of the foundation models into the surgical domain for depth estimation. There is clear evidence in the results that zero-shot prediction on pre-trained weights in computer vision datasets or naive fine-tuning is not sufficient to use the foundation model in the surgical domain directly.

An obstacle to reverse engineering neural networks is that many of the parameters inside a network are not involved in the computation being implemented by the network.

Singular learning theory teaches us that neural network parameterizations are biased towards being more degenerate, and parameterizations with more degeneracy are likely to generalize further. We identify 3 ways that network parameters can be degenerate: linear dependence between activations in a layer; linear dependence between gradients passed back to a layer; ReLUs which fire on the same subset of datapoints. We also present a heuristic argument that modular networks are likely to be more degenerate, and we develop a metric for identifying modules in a network that is based on this argument. We propose that if we can represent a neural network in a way that is invariant to reparameterizations that exploit the degeneracies, then this representation is likely to be more interpretable, and we provide some evidence that such a representation is likely to have sparser interactions.

Such homogeneity of self-attention reduces the diversity of representations, worsening scalability and dense prediction performance. (2) CL utilizes the low-frequency signals of the representations, but MIM utilizes high-frequencies.

We use shared input and output vocab embedding tables to reduce memory requirements and inference cost. These shared embedding tensors are mapped without duplications. The on-device model uses a vocab size of 49K, while the server model uses a vocab size of 100K, which includes additional language and technical tokens.</p> <p>For on-device inference, we use low-Bit Palettization, a critical optimization technique that achieves the necessary memory, power, and performance requirements. To maintain model quality, we developed a new framework using LoRA adapters that incorporates a mixed 2-bit and 4-bit configuration strategy \u2014 averaging 3.5 bits-per-weight \u2014 to achieve the same accuracy as the uncompressed models.</p> <p>Additionally, we use an interactive model latency and power analysis tool,\u00a0Talaria, to better guide the bit rate selection for each operation.
